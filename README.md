# Data Warehouse (DWH) Project

This repository contains SQL scripts and instructions for creating and analyzing a data warehouse (DWH) using PostgreSQL. The project involves creating a set of tables to manage regions, sales representatives, accounts, web events, and orders. Additionally, the project includes several analytical tasks to generate insights from the data.

## Prerequisites

- PostgreSQL installed
- Access to `psql` command-line tool
- CSV data files for bulk uploading: `region.csv`, `sales_rep.csv`, `accounts.csv`, `web_events.csv`, `orders.csv`

## Database Creation

To create the database and tables, use the provided SQL scripts.

## Bulk Uploading Data

Bulk upload data from CSV files into the corresponding tables using the `psql` command.

## Analytical Tasks

### Task 1: Sales Representative and Account Assignment

Join the `SALES_REP` and `ACCOUNTS` tables to retrieve sales representatives along with the accounts they are assigned to. Calculate the row number of each account per sales representative.
